<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used<br>
    for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.<br>
    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>
<p/>
<p>
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,<br>
    including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
</p>
<p>
    his separation can improve content accessibility;<br>
    provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;<br>
    enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in<br>
    a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;<br>
    and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between<br>
    the pages that share the file and its formatting.
</p>
<p>
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it<br>
    feasible to present the same markup page in different styles<br>
    for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print,<br>
    by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),<br>
    and on Braille-based tactile devices.<br>
    CSS also has rules for alternate formatting<br>
    if the content is accessed on a mobile device.<br>
